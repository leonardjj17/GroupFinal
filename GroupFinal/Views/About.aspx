    <p spellcheck="true">Long ago, a leprechaun named O'Shea Shenanigan landed in Dublin Ohio, after running far away from his Irish brothers. He had been reckless in his drinking, and had used almost all of his gold learning to bake pizzas as weird as that sounds. He took what remained of his pot of gold and invested it into a pub and pizzeria, because the last thing the other leprechauns would expect is a pizza place ran by a leprechaun.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Today the store is no longer run by the leprechaun but we carry on O'Shea's tradition. The best pizza, the coldest beers, and the charm that will keep you coming back. O'Shea Shenanigan's Pub and Pizza is the best Irish pizzeria probably because it's the only Irish pizza place.</p>
